## Options

#### Sync Interval

Modification of this option isn't recommended, since Settings Sync will detect local settings changes and sync accordingly.

By default, it checks every 15 minutes (900 seconds) for upstream changes. You can change this value in the settings, but keep in mind that too low of a value will probably result in you getting rate limited by Github.
